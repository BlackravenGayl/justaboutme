     <h1><center>MY BIOGRAPHY</center></h1>
     <P><center>Hey guys!so welcome to my very own page.I am called Anthea,a high high school student offering Computer Sciences and Technology.I am a talented high school senior with a passion for the written word.<br> As the editor of my school’s newspaper IT assistant I fearlessly delve into the latest stories and issues. But that’s not all I am also an avid reader and writer, always eager to explore new literary worlds and discover fresh perspectives.<br>

My dedication to academic excellence has earned me a spot in the esteemed National Honor Society. With my curious spirit and unwavering drive, I am sure to make a meaningful impact wherever my literary journey takes me.</center></P>

<h1><center>MY HOBBIES</center></h1>
<ul>
	<li><h3>DIY projects:</h3>Whenever I am  bored with the same interiors at home,I try some DIY projects and revamp.</li>
	<li><h3>Candle making:</h3> It is easy to make and can be a way to earn some money.I just mix up scents, come up with a collection and start selling them.</li>
	<li><h3>Reading books:</h3> This never goes out of style. Reading books take you to imaginary destinations, teach you lessons which are not taught in school and improves your communication skills too.</li>
	<li><h3>Journal writing:</h3> I pick up a cute notebook from the nearest store and start journaling about my daily experiences in life</li>
	<li><h3>Learn makeup:</h3>I am a makeup enthusiast, I learn airbrush makeup, high definition contouring and I am now a pro in it.</li>
	<li><h3>Baking:</h3> Cakes, cupcakes, pastries and more. Baking is an art and teens with an undying love for sweets can pursue this as a hobby(ps:teens like me :)</li>
